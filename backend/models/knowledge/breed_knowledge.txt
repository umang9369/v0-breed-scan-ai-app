CROSSBREED IDENTIFICATION:
- Crossbreeds show mixed characteristics from parent breeds
- Size, color, and conformation may vary significantly
- Milk yield typically intermediate between parent breeds
- May show hybrid vigor in some traits like disease resistance
- Common crossbreeds: Jersey x Sahiwal, Holstein x Gir, etc.
- Identification requires knowledge of parent breed characteristics

MIXED BREED CHARACTERISTICS:
- Color patterns may be irregular or mixed
- Size may be intermediate or variable
- Milk production varies widely
- Adaptability often better than pure exotic breeds
- May show characteristics of multiple breeds

UNCERTAIN IDENTIFICATION FACTORS:
- Poor image quality or lighting
- Partial view of the animal
- Non-standard breed characteristics
- Crossbreed or mixed breed animals
- Young animals not showing full breed characteristics
- Animals with unusual color variations
- Health conditions affecting appearance

BREED IDENTIFICATION TIPS:
- Look for distinctive color patterns and markings
- Consider the size and body conformation
- Note the presence and size of hump
- Observe ear shape and size
- Consider the region where the animal is found
- Look for breed-specific characteristics
- Consider the animal's age and development stage
